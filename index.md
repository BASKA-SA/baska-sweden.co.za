## Help get the winning team to Sweden in 2018

BASKA is going to Sweden in 2018 and you can help! 40 of our karateka have
qualified for the world championships which will be held in Stockholm in June
next year. We need to raise funds to pay for this exciting event. Have a look
at the ways you can get involved. If we all pull together we can get our team
to Sweden!

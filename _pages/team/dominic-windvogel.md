Dominic Windvogel, 20

Black belt, Dominic ‘Mr Gains’ Windvogel hails from Belhar in Cape Town. The oldest sibling in a strong karate family, Dominic has been training for over 10 years and packs a mean punch. He looks up to Shihan Chris Thompson, not just for his impressive karate skills, but also for his spirit and character. Dominic was well placed in Germany in 2016 and aims to be in the medals this year. Dominic is studying to be an engineer and enjoys playing guitar and sketching.

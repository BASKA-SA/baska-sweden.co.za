Alex Pass, 13

Alek, the ‘Bodyguard’, Pass is aiming to put his lightning footwork and mean change of direction, acquired on the soccer field, to good use when he attends his second world championship in Sweden. Alek can hardly remember the days before karate as he has been training since he was just 4 years old. When he is not taking selfies, he enjoys school, soccer karate training and a good chicken gatsby.

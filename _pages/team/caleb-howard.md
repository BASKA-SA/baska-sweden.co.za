Caleb Howard, 28
<br>Aka Cala, Die Rooi Gefaar

Caleb was awarded sportsman of the year for 2016 for the Cape Winelands District.
He is 3rd dan black belt and has been training for 12 years. He originally
decided to do Karate to improve his concentration and schoolwork, or at least
thatâ€™s what he says. Caleb lives in Northpine, Cape Town and is also a pretty
slick hip hop dancer and keen surfer.

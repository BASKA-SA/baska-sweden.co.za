Caleb Howard, 28
<br>Aka Cala, Die Rooi Gefaar

Caleb was awarded sportsman of the year for 2016 for the Cape Winelands District.
He is a 3 Dan black belt and has been training for 12 years. He originally
decided to do Karate to improve his concentration and schoolwork, or at least
thatâ€™s what he says. Caleb lives in Northpine, Cape Town and is also a pretty
slick hip hop dancer and keen surfer.

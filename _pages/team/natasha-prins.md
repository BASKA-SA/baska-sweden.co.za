Natasha Prins, 18

With Seven world titles, second Dan black belt, Natasha Prins is our not so secret weapon. She started karate to build her confidence and learn how to defend herself, however she was immediately hooked and has now been training for over 13 years. Natasha takes no prisoners in the dojo yet still finds time for reading, dancing and playing netball.

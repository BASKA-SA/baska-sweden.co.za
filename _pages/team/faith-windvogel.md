Faith Windvogel, 15

Junior 1st Dan black belt Faith ‘Fay Fay’ Windvogel has been training since she was just 6 years old and has been to 2 world championships already. With three other black belts in the family she has plenty of role models to look up to, but if forced to pick one, would choose Shihan Lionel as he is a great teacher. Faith loves to sing and hopes to fit that in with her studies in future.

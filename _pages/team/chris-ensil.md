Sensei Chris Ensil, 61

7th Dan black belt, Sensei Chris Ensil, has more accolades and achievements than we can fit on this webpage - he has competed on all continents except South America (just one to go Sensei), and was world champion in 2004 and 2014. Born and raised in Woodstock, he started Karate as a means to protect himself, and has been doing karate for many more years than most of his students have been alive. Although we all think Sensei trains all the time, he does find some time off for his two other passions, boxing and soccer. Sensei is a devout Catholic and looks up to Jesus as his biggest hero.

Dillon Windvogel, 17

Aspiring actor and dancer, Dillon ‘Puffy D’ Windvogel was born into a karate family in Belhar, Cape Town. When your siblings and father are all black belts, what choice do you have? Dillon, also known as ‘Loaf’ has been training for more than 10 years and looks up to Shihan Chris Thompson. We’re not sure whether the local Gatsby which he enjoys so much is his secret weapon or just his favourite food.

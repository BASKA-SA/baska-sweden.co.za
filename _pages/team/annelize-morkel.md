Sensei Annelize Morkel, 37

Sweden 2018 will be a fifth world championship for 4th Dan Black Belt, ‘Sensei Anna’ who already has a gold and silver medal to her name. She won gold for kumite in Germany in 2016, and placed second in kata at that tournament. She started training a long, long time ago and has her own dojo in Villiersdorp. Sensei Annelize loves the structure, discipline and self-confidence that karate brings and trains 4 to 6 times a week by herself and with her Sensei. She loves reading, being active, teaching young children and her fitness classes with the ladies in her community. While Sensei aspires to be the best and most authentic version of herself and to make a difference to the youth who look up to her, we are looking forward to more medals in Sweden.

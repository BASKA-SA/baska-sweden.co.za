title: The Road to Sweden
---

40 of our students have qualified for the South African KSI team to go to the
world championships in Stockholm next year. They have done so by placing either
first or second at the 2017 national championships held in October. While this
is a huge achievement in itself, it's just another step along the way to the big
tournament next year.

To be able to do us proud next year, the team will need to carry on training at
least three times a week, compete in all the development tournaments available,
attend the training camps and keep learning from our experienced Senseis. As well
as this the team will need to raise the finances to fund the trip by the end of
March next year. Our goal is to raise R2 million in order to send the full team
plus support staff to the KSI World Championships 2018 in Sweden.

title: The Road to Sweden
---

BASKA first sent a team to the world championships in the 1990's<!-- in ï¿½ -->. Since then we
have competed in many world championships, have produced dozens of world champions and
brought home hundreds of medals. And it's not just the medals, we are changing
lives. Not only have we taught hundreds of students the values of respect and
self-discipline, we have taught them to believe in themselves and shown them
that through hard work, self belief and perseverance they can achieve their dreams.

40 of our students have qualified for the South African KSI team to go to the
world championships in Stockholm in 2018. They have done so by placing either
first or second at the 2017 national championships held in October. While this
is a huge achievement in itself, it's just another step along the way to the big
tournament in July.

To be able to do us proud, the team will need to carry on training at
least three times a week, compete in all the development tournaments available,
attend the training camps and keep learning from our experienced Senseis. As well
as this, the team will need to raise the finances to fund the trip.
Our goal is to raise R1.5 million in order to send the full team
plus support staff to the KSI World Championships 2018 in Sweden.
